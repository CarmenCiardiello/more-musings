My name is Carmen Ciardiello. I am an engineer who has worked in an MLB front office as a Research & Development Analyst and have written at FanGraphs as a part-time contributor. You can easily look back at my FanGraphs archive by searching for name followed by FanGraphs. Some of my early research can be found at sabermetricmusings.blogspot.com.  

Feel free to contact me on Twitter or email my at cciardiello1@gmail.com with any questions for concerns regarding my work on this site or anything else that may cross your mind. I am always happy to discuss baseball, other sports, programming, and all combinations thereof.
