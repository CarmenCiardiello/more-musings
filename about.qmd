My name is Carmen Ciardiello. I am an engineer who has worked in a MLB front office as a Research & Development Analyst and have written at FanGraphs as a part-time contributor. You can easily look back at my FanGraphs archive by searching for my name followed by FanGraphs. Some of my early research can be found at sabermetricmusings.blogspot.com, which can be accessed by clicking on the archive icon.  

Feel free to contact me on Twitter or email me at cciardiello1@gmail.com with any questions or concerns regarding my work on this site or anything else that may cross your mind. I am always happy to discuss baseball, hockey, programming, and all combinations thereof.
